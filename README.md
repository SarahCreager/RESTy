# RESTy

## Problem Domain

Part 3 of a 4-Phase build of the RESTy application. The initial build set up the file structure in order to progressively build the application in a scalable manner. This application can receive user input in preparation of connecting to live APIs, using the useState() hook in our functional components. Now the application can connect with APIs, running live requests.

## Features 

* Converted all child components of App.js from classes to functions. 

* Use .scss files to style each component

* Core application functionality remain unchanged.

* Refactored components using this.setState to implement the useState react API hook.

* Refactored the Form Component to implement user input from form elements, instead of hard coded string values.

* Refactored application methods to allow for browser side HTTP requests to be sent. The user can set a url, method, and request body.

* Make sure all relavent request and response data is displayed to the user.
