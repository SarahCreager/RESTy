# RESTy

## Problem Domain

Today, we begin the first of a 4-Phase build of the RESTy application, written in React. In this first phase, the goal is to setup the basic scaffolding of the application, with intent being to add more functionality to the system as we go. This initial build sets up the file structure so that we can progressively build this application in a scalable manner.

In phase 2, we will be receiving user input in preparation of connecting to live APIs, using the useState() hook in our functional components

## Features 

* Converted all child components of App.js from classes to functions. 

* Use .scss files to style each component

* Core application functionality remain unchanged.

* Refactor any components using this.setState to implement the useState react API hook.

* Refactor the Form Component to implement user input from form elements, instead of hard coded string values.
